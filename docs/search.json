Basically, this means there’s no physical interaction between the sensors and the object. It involves observing and collecting data about Earth’s surface.\nRemote sensing allows us to see beyond what the human eye can detect. For instance, we can generate detailed topographic maps of the Earth’s surface although we haven’t been there. This capability enables us to easily distinguish between different land cover types such as urban areas, oceans, and vegetation, providing invaluable information for environmental monitoring, urban planning, agriculture, and various other applications.",

    "text": "3.6 Application of corrections in literature\nIn the realm of environmental applications, atmospheric correction plays a pivotal role in enhancing the accuracy of remote sensing data. papers are about various atmospheric correction techniques, namely Quick Atmospheric Correction (QUAC), Dark Object Subtraction (DOS), Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH), ATCOR 2, ATCOR 3, and the Empirical Line Method (ELM), applied to Landsat imagery across diverse studies.\nThe study by Dewi and Trisakti compared QUAC, DOS, and FLAASH methods, revealing that FLAASH produced images with significantly altered contrasts, suggesting an effective atmospheric correction. However, the spectral analysis indicated that FLAASH was not as effective, especially for vegetation and water bodies, likely due to the specific atmospheric and aerosol variables prevalent in the Indonesian context. Conversely, QUAC and DOS methods exhibited more accurate spectral patterns for vegetation and water, with DOS particularly aligning closer to the Surface Reflectance (SR) data from the USGS, demonstrating its efficacy in producing compatible spectral patterns.\nOn the other hand, Tan et al.’s evaluation of ATCOR 2, ATCOR 3, FLAASH, and ELM highlighted ATCOR 3 as the most accurate for Ground Reflectance (GR) and Particulate Matter less than 10 µm (PM10), while ELM excelled in Total Suspended Solids (TSS) analysis. This study underscores the nuanced efficacy of different atmospheric correction methods depending on the environmental parameter in question, with ATCOR 3 showing a high correlation coefficient for GR and PM10 data, thus suggesting its suitability for precise environmental monitoring.\nThese papers underscore the critical need to select atmospheric correction techniques based on the specific requirements of the study and the inherent characteristics of the data being processed. While FLAASH demonstrated a visually improved contrast, its spectral analysis accuracy was outperformed by DOS in the Indonesian context, hinting at the method’s sensitivity to local atmospheric conditions. Meanwhile, ATCOR 3’s superior performance in correlating GR and PM10 data positions it as a robust choice for environmental applications requiring high precision.\nIn conclusion, while FLAASH offers visual enhancements, its application in spectral accuracy is context-dependent. DOS emerges as a versatile and effective method, particularly for land cover analysis in areas similar to Indonesia. The distinct superiority of ATCOR 3 in handling GR and PM10 data makes it indispensable for environmental monitoring where precision is paramount.",

    "text": "3.7 Reflections\nReflecting on this week’s content, I’m particularly fascinated by the complex interplay between the theoretical aspects of remote sensing data processing and their practical applications in environmental monitoring. The nuanced understanding of atmospheric attenuation, radiometric calibration, and the various corrections—geometric, atmospheric, and orthorectification—highlights the intricate challenges inherent in deriving accurate and useful data from satellite imagery. The notion that the journey of electromagnetic radiation, from its source to the sensor, is fraught with alterations by atmospheric conditions, terrain, and human-induced factors, underscores the importance of these corrections in ensuring data reliability.\nThe methodologies and tools discussed, such as radiative transfer models (e.g., MODTRAN 4+ and Py6S) and the empirical line method, showcase the scientific community’s efforts to enhance data accuracy. It’s enlightening to understand that despite the complexity of these processes, advancements in remote sensing technologies and algorithms have made it increasingly feasible to obtain high-quality, corrected datasets. This progression not only makes remote sensing data more accessible but also amplifies its utility across a broad spectrum of environmental studies.\nFrom a personal standpoint, the aspect of atmospheric correction and its critical role in environmental applications captivates me. Knowing that different correction methods (e.g., DOS, FLAASH, ATCOR) can yield varied results depending on the specific context (e.g., vegetation, water bodies, atmospheric conditions) provides a deep insight into the necessity of selecting the appropriate technique for each study. This selection process, nuanced and dependent on the environmental parameter in question, exemplifies the critical thinking required in environmental science.\nLooking to the future, the skills and knowledge gained this week have profound implications for my potential involvement in environmental monitoring projects. Understanding how to process and correct remote sensing data ensures that I can contribute to generating accurate and meaningful insights into environmental changes, such as deforestation, urban expansion, and climate change impacts. Moreover, the discussion about dataset joining and enhancements like contrast, edge, and texture enhancements piques my interest in exploring how these techniques can be applied to improve data visualization and interpretation.\nHowever, the acknowledgment of the limitations and potential inaccuracies inherent in atmospheric correction algorithms serves as a reminder of the need for continuous improvement in remote sensing technologies and methodologies. It suggests that while current tools and data are immensely valuable, there is always room for innovation that could lead to even more precise and reliable environmental monitoring solutions.",

    "section": "1.2 How it works?",
    "text": "1.2 How it works?\nRemote sensing works by detecting and measuring the electromagnetic waves that is reflected by objects on Earth. This process involves several key steps:\n\nEnergy source: An energy source, usually the sun or sensors, provides electromagnetic radiation (1.2.2) that illuminates the Earth’s surface.\nRadiation and the atmosphere: The Earth’s atmosphere interacts with the incoming radiation, absorbing or scattering (1.2.3) some wavelengths while allowing others to pass through.\nInteraction with Earth’s surface (1.2.4): When the radiation reaches the Earth’s surface, different objects — such as water, forests, buildings, and fields — reflect, absorb, or transmit the radiation in various ways, depending on their material and structure.\nDetection by sensors: Sensors on satellites or aircraft then detect and record the reflected radiation.\nAnalysis using SNAP and R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: geoinfotech\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.1 Sensors\nSensors can be mounted on any platform, such as satellites and aircraft mentioned above. They are designed to capture data in specific wavelengths or bands, which can reveal different features of the Earth’s surface.\nThere are two type of sensors:\n\nPassive: Don’t emit anything and detect reflected energy from the sun which is in electromagnetic waves;\nActive: Have an energy source which emits electromagnetic waves and then waits to receive\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Electromagnetic waves\nThe electromagnetic spectrum is a broad classification that organizes electromagnetic waves according to their wavelengths and frequencies. It ranges from very short wavelengths, such as gamma rays and X-rays, to very long wavelengths, like radio waves. The visible spectrum, which can be detected by the human eye, is just a small part of the entire electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: OnlineLearningCollege\n\n\n\n\nEmitted electromagnetic radiation with different wavelengths (bands) interacts with the surface materials and is then reflected back to the sensor. By analyzing the reflected signals, which vary across different materials due to their distinct reflectance properties, active sensors can identify and distinguish between various types of land cover. For example, vegetation absorbing most visible light for photosynthesis but reflecting much of the near-infrared light.\nElectromagnetic waves are part of electromagnetic radiation. However, sometimes they can be seen as the same.\n\n\n1.2.3 Scattering\nScattering, a process where particles deflect incoming light in various directions, affects how we perceive color in our environment.\n\n1.2.3.1 Why is the sky blue?\nThere are three types of atmospheric scattering:\n\nRayleigh = particles are very small compared to the wavelength\nMie = particles are the same size compared to the wavelength\nNon selective = particles are much larger than the wavelength Sunlight is scattered by particles in the atmosphere\n\nThe sky appears blue due to Rayleigh scattering of shorter - blue - wavelengths by atmospheric particles. However, at sunrise or sunset there is much more atmosphere to pass through so more scattering occurs and red and orange light reach our eyes instead of blue.\n\n\n1.2.3.2 Why is the ocean blue?\nSimilarly, the ocean’s blue color results from the water’s absorption of longer wavelengths and scattering of blue light. Shallow water can is clear as not many molecules scatter the light. And deeper ocean with more molecules scattering will appear blue.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft:shallow water. Right: deep water Source: wordsinmocean\n\n\n\n\nThink: Why does the moon have a black sky?\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Interacting with Earth’s surface\nThe Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) describes how light is reflected at different angles, affecting the appearance of Earth’s surface from space.",
