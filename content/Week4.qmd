title: "Saving Lagos from Oil Pollution"
---
It's week 4! This week, I choose a city Lagos in Nigeria which faces the risk of oil pollution all year round. Let's see how can remote sensing data combined with policies save this city.

## The oil pollution in Lagos

Over the past 50 years, it's estimated that more than 1.5 million tons of oil have spilled in the Niger Delta. Residential areas in nine districts of the delta suffer from oil spills every year due to accidental discharges and operational spills. Lagos, being one of the most populous cities in Africa, faces numerous environmental challenges, including the risk of oil spills due to its proximity to the Niger Delta.

## Policy

- Global Policy: Emphasizes international cooperation in environmental protection and oil spill response, following guidelines set by organizations such as the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).

- Metropolitan Policy: Lagos State's policies focus on sustainable urban development, environmental protection, and disaster risk management. These include measures to prevent industrial pollution and ensure quick response to environmental disasters.

## Applications of remote sensing
### Datasets
The oil spill data, oil well data, and oil pipeline network data are complemented by EO datasets such as SPOT 6 DEM and Imagery, soil maps, and land use landcover maps. These datasets are instrumental in mapping and analyzing the spatial distribution of oil facilities and incidents. The high-resolution SPOT 6 imagery and DEM, with resolutions of 20m and 10m respectively, enable precise identification of oil spill locations and the surrounding environmental context. 

### Risk assessment

First, using GIS-based Kernel Density algorithms to identify hotspots of oil spill incidents and high-density areas for oil facilities.

Then, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and soil map data can be used to assess the risk and vulnerability of different areas to oil spills incorporating land cover. Using a GIS-based fuzzy logic model (FLM) helps in generating oil spill hazard, vulnerability, and risk indices, categorizing areas by risk level. The output values were categorized into five classes: Very High risk (VHR), High risk (HR), Moderate risk (MR), Low risk (LR), and Very Low risk (VLR). Each hazard was characterized by its origin, magnitude, frequency, and probability. Fuzzification and fuzzy overlay algorithms were employed to generate a hazard model by integrating potential sources of events. Vulnerability refers to the level of exposure of both the natural ecosystem and anthropogenic establishments to potential oil spills.

The risk assessment is generated by the integration of the generated hazard and vulnerability maps.

### Policy application
The remotely sensed data and derived models support policy goals by enabling evidence-based decision-making. For Lagos, this means identifying areas at greatest risk more efficiently, accuratly and effectively, prioritizing resources for monitoring and clean-up, and informing urban planning to reduce vulnerability to spills.

## Reflection
Engaging with this data and its application in Lagos has been an enlightening experience, showcasing the power of remotely sensing data in addressing complex environmental challenges. The intersection of technology, policy, and environmental science opens new avenues for sustainable urban development and disaster risk management. This case study not only deepens my understanding of the challenges faced by cities like Lagos but also highlights the potential for remote sensing technologies to contribute to global and local environmental goals. It's evident how critical remotely sensing data can be in not only understanding but actively mitigating the environmental impacts of industrial activities. I think the skills and methods applied here are not limited to oil spill monitoring but extend to broader environmental and urban challenges.
