	abstract = {Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) provides high resolution horizontal and vertical spatial point cloud data, and is increasingly being used in a number of applications and disciplines, which have concentrated on the exploit and manipulation of the data using mainly its three dimensional nature. LiDAR information potential is made even greater though, with its consideration of intensity.},

@article{chenObjectBasedMethodUrban2014,
	abstract = {Airborne Lidar (Light detection and ranging) data have been widely used for classifying different land cover types. However, few researchers have conducted urban land cover classification using discrete airborne Lidar data as the sole data source. This research explores the possibility of applying airborne Lidar data to land cover classification in urban areas. The elevation difference and intensity difference between the first and last return, which may not work efficiently in pixelbased classification, were employed as two key attributes at the object level. Since tree objects have a much larger proportion of returns which show the elevation and intensity difference, the two indicators were used to classify the most indistinguishable land cover types, buildings and trees. In addition, height and intensity information were integrated to classify other land cover types. A case study was conducted in the city of Cambridge and eight urban land cover types were classified with an overall accuracy of 93.6\%. Each land cover type was classified with an accuracy of between 80\% and 100\% and among these types, the accuracy of more than 90\% for trees and buildings was satisfactory.},

@article{wangChallengesOpportunitiesLidar2021,
	abstract = {Future lidar applications can go beyond the traditional fields discussed above. Short-range 2-D/3-D lidar advanced rapidly driven by autonomous vehicle development needs. Further developments of all-fiber lidar could provide a reliable and cost-effective way to detect turbulence, wind shear, volcanic ash, supercooled liquid clouds with icing risks, and high ice water content clouds from aircraft in real-time to support safe aircraft operations (Schmitt, 2017; Thobois et al., 2019). If we successfully meet these challenges, lidar measurements from ground, aircraft, and satellite will continuously transform our capability to support earth system science study and power new lidar applications.},
