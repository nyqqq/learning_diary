# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This is a learning diary created by Yuqing Niu.

I come from Shanghai, China, and I am a food and travel enthusiast. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Shanghai University, and my undergraduate thesis focused on optimization algorithms in dynamic systems. I am currently studying Urban Spatial Science at UCL's Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA). I have a passion for data analysis, mathematical modeling, and the application of optimization algorithms in spatial contexts.

This learning diary, created with Quarto and Xaringan, is primarily inspired by the course CASA0023: Remotely Sensing Cities and Environment, led by Andy. The diary introduces key learnings from the course materials provided. I extend my sincere gratitude to Andy for his invaluable guidance and expertise.

Should you spot any inaccuracies or wish to offer feedback, I welcome you to reach out. Moreover, I'm always open to engaging in discussions about remote sensing. Feel free to contact me for any queries or dialogue.
